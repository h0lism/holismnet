Across the globe and throughout history, cultures have recognized and harnessed the transformative power of sound. While the specific forms and philosophies may differ, the underlying principle remains consistent: certain sounds, when uttered with intention and devotion, can serve as potent tools for healing, spiritual growth, connection with others, and inner experience. 

In the realm of **Christianity**, the ethereal melodies of **Gregorian Chants**, often sung in Latin, have long been used in liturgical settings. A liturgical setting is a song which is set to an ancient text and sung during worship to reinforce a specific part of the service. 

Similarly, we see in the **Jewish** tradition **cantillation**, a mode of intonation used in the public recital of prayers and Holy Scripture. Cantillation uses specific note patterns to add an additional layer of meaning and musical expression to the words. 

Moving east, the mystical Islamic tradition of Sufism offers another compelling example. **Sufi Dhikr**, Dhikr meaning ”**the remembrance of God**,” involves the rhythmic repetition of God's names or sacred phrases. This practice is often accompanied by movement and breathwork. 

We can also see examples within Native American cultures, different shamanistic traditions, and tribes across the world.

Here we stumble upon a universal truth that transcends cultural boundaries - people are moved by sound and repetition has tremendous value. 

All religions have created mantras and daily recitations — often short distilled phrases that are easy to recall and recite daily. These become the tiny anchoring points that help one to deal with the fluid vicissitudes of life. What is spoken automatically and subliminally sinks it’s way into the non-conscious mind, guiding someone towards the core principles of their faith. Repetition makes our feet sink deeper into the sand. Neuroplasticity allows us to connect to the feeling state of whatever you are repeating after it has become engrained in your brains wiring over time. Your non-conscious mind will build out, and then be trained, at faster and faster speeds, to regularly access dendrite trees and associated schemas which are linked with the subject of repetition, therefore eventually being able to bring these ideas and associated memories/energy into the conscious mind on a whim. You begin to, as you chant, step into mental and then energetic resonance with what you are repeating. The conscious mind utilizes the mantra as an anchor point, the non-conscious mind then begins to organize itself around this anchor, bringing up different internal ques which seek to drive the conscious into the state which the nonconscious has been trained to hold via this pathway.
